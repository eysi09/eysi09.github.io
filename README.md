================

A github repo for my github.io page. 

Currently shows the super simple [KRÓNÓS](https://eysi09.github.io/) "app". Enter units of time and multiply/divide them or add/subtract them to/from other units of time. A favour for a friend who asked if an app fitting the description could be written and deployed within 60 minutes. Turns out it can be done.
